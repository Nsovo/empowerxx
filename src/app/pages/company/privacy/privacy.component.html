        Privacy Notice
      </h5>
   <p>
    EmpowerXx’s core mission is to match candidates with a job they love and to connect the world’s most innovative companies with top female talent. It is, therefore, an essential part of our Service that information you submit through the Service be made available to other users. Your information may also be shared with other EmpowerXx Services of which you are not a user, as well as potentially transmitted to third parties as set forth herein. EmpowerXx is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and the information that You share in connection with your use of EmpowerXx’s Services. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, transfer, and disclose your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications, and other online products and services where this Policy is posted (collectively, the “Services”). EmpowerXx may provide additional notices through our Services in addition to these practices or provide you additional choices about how EmpowerXx may process your Personal Information. If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at support@EmpowerXx.com.
    By submitting information, including Personal Information, through our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as well as our Data Processing Agreement, Cookie Policy, and any other documentation referenced herein. If you do not agree, you should discontinue use of the Services immediately.
    We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time and will indicate when changes have been made by revising the date at the top of this Policy. We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you access the Services to make sure that you understand our information collection, use, and disclosure practices. When we make material changes to this Policy, we will provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. We may notify you in advance.

   <h5>
    Information That We Collect and How We Use It
   </h5>
    <p>
        2.1. Information That You Provide to Us
        We will collect information that you provide to us when you use the Services, such as when you (1) create an account; (2) send questions or comments via the Service, email, or chat to EmpowerXx or other users; (3) fill out surveys; or (4) otherwise communicate with us or other users through or about the Services. We will also collect information when you sign up for marketing emails, events, or other opportunities through EmpowerXx. Information collected may contain personal information such as your name, email address, billing and contact information, and other identifying information you may provide to EmpowerXx (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may also contain third party personally identifiable information You provide to EmpowerXx through Your use of the Service(s), of which you remain liable for at all times. Aggregated, non-personally identifying information is not your personal information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and service. 
        
        2.2. Information We Collect About Your Use of Our Services
        EmpowerXx automatically records certain information about your use of the Services. EmpowerXx uses a variety of technologies to collect this information, including persistent and session cookies, web beacons, and pixel tracking technology. The information we collect includes number of log-ins, actions taken, data displayed or clicked on (e.g., UI elements, links), and other login information (e.g., browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, referrer URL, etc.). We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Service, track users’ movements around the Service, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, we use “Pixel Tags” in the provision of our Services to you. Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier that are used to track online movements of web users. Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We also use analytics tools to collect information regarding your service usage to improve our Services.
        
        EmpowerXx may collect automated error reports in the case of software malfunction; such error reports may contain some or all of the information in your accounts and may be reviewed to help resolve problems with the EmpowerXx Service. If you participate in a videoconference with us, we may record the session and retain recordings of the session if we notify you that the session is being recorded and allow you the opportunity to opt out.
        
        2.3. Information We Collect from Third Parties
        Any Personal Information that EmpowerXx may obtain from other third-party sources will be processed by EmpowerXx in accordance with this Policy and all applicable laws. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Services in order to improve the Services we provide to you.
        
        2.4. How We Use The Information We Collect
        We use your Personal Information in connection with providing you with the Services and product features. Here are some examples of how we use your information:
        
        To provide, develop, and enhance the Service;
        Provide and deliver the products and services you request, process transactions, and to send you related information including confirmations and invoices;
        To respond to feedback and monitor security of the Service;
        To provide users with promotional communications, materials, and other third-party information;
        To enforce our terms or rights under any agreement between you and EmpowerXx; and,
        To perform any other action deemed necessary by EmpowerXx in its provision of the Service, interactions with you, or any other third party.
        
        We may also store information locally on your device, for instance in your local cache. EmpowerXx reserves the right to review any information to help resolve problems with our Services or to ensure compliance with our Terms of Service.
        
    </p> 
   <h5>
    The Legal Basis on Which EmpowerXx Collects Your Personal Information
   </h5>
    <p>
        EmpowerXx collects and processes your Personal Information on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Information being provided and the type of processing involved as follows:
    
        3.1. Performance of a Contract
        Some of the Personal Information processed by EmpowerXx is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement. An example of this would be where EmpowerXx sends an interview request to a Candidate from an Employer.
        
        3.2. Legitimate Interest
        A second ground relied upon by EmpowerXx for other types of processing of your Personal Information is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by EmpowerXx. Such legitimate interests will include where EmpowerXx sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention. EmpowerXx will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.
        
        3.3. Compliance with a Legal Obligation
        A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow EmpowerXx to comply with a legal obligation. An example of this would be where EmpowerXx is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time in order to comply with local legal requirements.
        
        3.4. Consent
        Finally, in certain limited situations, EmpowerXx relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Information. Where EmpowerXx requires your consent in order to collect and process certain Personal Information, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured. For example, if you no longer want to receive marketing materials from us based upon your Personal Information, there are a number of options available to you. If you wish to opt out of a particular marketing email from EmpowerXx, you may do so by clicking “unsubscribe” (or an equivalent action) where applicable. Please note that this will only opt you out of that particular marketing campaign. You can also access and adjust your marketing communications subscriptions from your account dashboard or contact support@EmpowerXx.com to do so. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable, and in accordance with applicable laws. 
        
    </p>
   <h5>
    Sharing Your Information
   </h5>
    <p>
        We may share your information as follows:
    
        With Other Users. We may share information about you, your interactions with the Service, Content you post, or other similar information with other users of our Services.
        With Other EmpowerXx Services. We may share information about you, your interactions with the Service, Content you post, or other similar information with other EmpowerXx Services, including those of which you are not a user.
        With Third Parties. We may share information about you with third parties, whether designated by you, or with other third parties including our service providers, business partners, and other organizations as we may choose.
        With Service Providers. We may share your Personal Information with third parties, such as vendors and service providers who provide assistance with billing, payment processing, marketing, data analytics support and service associated with our Services, including any provision of goods through our Services.
        With Business Partners and Affiliates. We may share your Personal Information with our channel partners, subsidiaries, affiliates, join ventures, or any other company, to fulfill obligations and requests, to deliver support, and to provide users and our customers’ users with information about EmpowerXx. EmpowerXx does not control how a business partner may use your Personal Information. Our business partners are responsible for managing the use of Personal information collected in these circumstances.
        For Compliance with laws and for other legitimate business purposes. We may share your Personal Information when we believe disclosure is necessary or required by law, due to corporate restructuring, change of control, regulation or regulatory action, to protect users, the integrity of the Service, and to defend or exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your Personal Information when it may be necessary for other legitimate purposes as reasonably determined by EmpowerXx.
        And Generally. We may share information with the general public, such as your name, username, profile picture, and any Content you post.    

    </p>
   <h5>
    Email Communication
   </h5>
  <p>
    We may send you emails, including marketing, promotional, and third-party related communications. You may opt out of these emails at any time by unsubscribing or selecting this option through our Services. Note that You may need to opt out from each EmpowerXx Service individually. Despite your election, we may still be required to send you Service-related communications, including any updates to our terms of service or this Policy.
    
  </p>
    <h5>
        Public Profile
    </h5>
    <p>
        As an essential element of the Service, most of the Personal Information you provide to us when you register or update your profile is displayed on your profile and intended to be shared with other users. Your photos, posts, and other content you post to the Site are also meant for public consumption. We may display this content on the Site, our Services, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put any sensitive, confidential, or any other information you do not wish to be shared in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Service, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Cookies and Flash LSOs</h5>
    <p>
        You may instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies at any time or set your browser to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please consult your browser’s settings for further technical information. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions or functionality of the Service. We may, or our third parties may, use “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies.
    </p>
    
    <h5>From Social Networking Sites</h5> 
    <p>
        If You provide information through, or sign in via, a social networking site such as facebook, google, or any other site we support, we may receive information from that site. Any information we receive may be dependent on the privacy settings you have with that site, so please consult that site’s privacy and data practices. We will not be responsible for any practices of that social networking site. You may de-link your social networking site account from EmpowerXx through Your EmpowerXx account, and may also change your sharing settings through such social networking site.
    </p>
   
    
    <h5>Feedback</h5>
    <p>
        We may publish any feedback we receive from you. We may identify you by your first and last name and may also indicate your home city. We may post any feedback on the Service from time to time. If you make any comments on a blog or forum associated with EmpowerXx, you should be aware that you have no reasonable expectation of privacy and that any Personal Information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these blogs and forums.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
        Retention, Modification, or Deletion of Your Information
    </h5>
    
    <p>
        You may change any of Your Personal Information in Your Account by editing Your profile within Your Account. Generally, EmpowerXx will retain user personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. We may retain certain user Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely or as long as allowable by law, whichever comes first.
    
        If you would like to cancel your account or delete your user Personal Information, you may do so in your user account, but we may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements before any such deletion. After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as messages to other users and comments, will remain. However, we will delete or deidentify your Personal Information, including your user name and email address, by associating them with an anonymous user. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.
