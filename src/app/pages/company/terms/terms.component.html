        Payments and Refunds
      </h5>
        <p>
            EmpowerXx is free for Candidates. As a Candidate, you are required to promptly notify EmpowerXx within five business days if you accept a Job Offer, whether for an indefinite or fixed term.

            For Employers
        </h5>
        <p>
            If a Candidate is identified through EmpowerXx and accepts a Job Offer within six months of the Candidate's EmpowerXx profile being visible to the Employer, you as the Employer will be charged a Placement Fee, regardless of whether the Candidate accepts an Interview Request. The Placement Fee (excluding VAT) is equal to 12.5% of the Candidate's annual total CTC, inclusive of all guaranteed income. EmpowerXx will invoice you within one week of the Candidate's Start Date and the Placement Fee shall be due 30 days after the Start Date.
            If you already had an Active Process with the Candidate, and complete the process on EmpowerXx, then a Placement Fee will be due. An Active Process means that there was at least one communication regarding a potential hiring (email, call, interview, ...) between the Candidate and the Employer at least 90 days before the Candidate's profile was made visible on the EmpowerXx platform.
        </p>

        <h5>

        </h5>
       <p>
        Our guarantee period, which is validated on receipt of payment on or before the 30th day from date of invoice, covers you in the event of the employee leaving your employ for any reason other than death, retrenchment or unfair labour practice.
        •	Should a Candidate within a period of 90 (ninety) days from commencement of employment depart from the company;
        •	Or be legitimately dismissed; and provided the Client had itself made payment strictly in terms of this agreement and the Client within a period of 10 days, notifies EmpowerXx in writing (unless otherwise agreed) of the termination of employment;
        A refund will only be due to the Employer where the relevant Placement Fee was paid in accordance with EmpowerXx's payment terms.
